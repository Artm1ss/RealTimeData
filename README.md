version 2.6.0. This is the version we use in this book, though in many cases, the code will also work with older or newer versions of the Kafka Streams library, as well. We will make efforts to update the source code when newer versions introduce breaking changes, and will stage these updates in a dedicated branch
ksqlDB servers are responsible for running your stream processing applications (which in the ksqlDB sense, would be a set of queries that work together to solve a business problem). Each server is conceptually similar to a single instance of a Kafka Streams application, and workloads (created by the query set) can be distributed across multiple ksqlDB servers with the same ksql.service.id configuration. Like Kafka Streams applications, ksqlDB servers are deployed separately from the Kafka cluster (usually on separate machines / containers from the brokerâ€™s themselves).
